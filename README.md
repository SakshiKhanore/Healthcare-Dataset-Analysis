🏥 Healthcare Data Analytics Project
📌 Business Problem

Healthcare providers need to balance patient care quality with efficient use of hospital resources. This project analyzes patient admission, treatment, and billing data to identify cost drivers, high-resource conditions, and operational patterns across hospital departments.

📊 Dataset Overview

~59,000 patient records

Fields include medical condition, department, age, gender, length of stay, admission date, and billing amount

🎯 Objectives

Analyze patient volume and admission trends

Identify departments and conditions with high resource utilization

Compare treatment cost and length of stay across medical conditions

Support data-driven healthcare planning and decision-making

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python: pandas, matplotlib

Tableau: Interactive dashboards for visualization

📈 Key Insights

Patient volumes are relatively uniform across major medical conditions

Oncology has the highest average length of stay and total billing, indicating higher operational burden

Chronic conditions contribute to sustained patient inflow, while acute conditions drive higher cost per patient

📌 Outcome

The analysis highlights opportunities for condition-specific resource allocation, cost optimization, and improved operational planning in healthcare settings.
